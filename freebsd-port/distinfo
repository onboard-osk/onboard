# Run "make makesum" on FreeBSD to generate checksums for the release tarball.
# TIMESTAMP and SIZE will also be filled in automatically.
#
# Example after running makesum:
# TIMESTAMP = 1700000000
# SHA256 (dr-ni-onboard-1.4.3.post9_GH0.tar.gz) = <hash>
# SIZE (dr-ni-onboard-1.4.3.post9_GH0.tar.gz) = <size>
