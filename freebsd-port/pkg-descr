Onboard is an onscreen keyboard useful for everybody that cannot use a
hardware keyboard; for example, tablet PC users or mobility impaired users.

It has been designed with simplicity in mind and can be used right away
without the need of any configuration, as it can read the keyboard layout
from the X server.

Features include:
- Multiple keyboard layouts (Compact, Full, Small, Phone, Grid, Whiteboard)
- Word prediction and auto-correction via language models
- Configurable themes and appearance
- D-Bus interface for external control
- Hover-click / scanning support for accessibility
- GNOME Shell extension for indicator integration
- Hunspell spell-checking integration
